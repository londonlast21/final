# TSafety Directory

## Description

TSafety Directory is a mobile-first app designed for transgender & gender-non-conforming individuals, with a secondary focus on privacy & anonymity.

When visiting the site without an account, users can see posts listing medical providers by name, location, and specialty.

Users who make an account can access additional features:
- seeing, adding & deleting reviews of providers
- submit a new provider entry

The purpose of this hidden content is to prevent accusations of slander, by restricting visibilty of personal reviews to users-only, and tagging reviews with the username of the writer.
